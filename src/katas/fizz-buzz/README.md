# FizzBuzz exercise

- Write a program that prints a string with one line for each number from 1 to 100
- Usually just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number
- The output should be written with 1 console.log statement.

- Practice test driven development. Write your solution and test in separate files. 
The test file should end in `*.spec.ts` to indicate it's the spesification of our program.
